### ðŸŒŸ Machine Learning for Ranking problems.

The problem of ranking documents in a given corpus is central to Information Retrieval. Although this problem has more notoriety in search engines, those ranking algorithms can be used in different solutions such as collaborative filtering, question answering, multimedia retrieval, text summarization, and online advertising.

Recently, regarding the massive amount of data available for training, it's become possible to leverage existing Machine Learning (ML) technologies to build more effective ranking models. Using supervised ML techniques to solve ranking problems is called Learning to Rank (LTR).
